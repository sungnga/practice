## SECTION 4: STORE API
- Folder directory: /04-store-api/

### Goals of this project
- We will learn about filtering, sorting, and dynamically populating our database
- We are in charge of the store API and we are providing options for the clients to query the store database
- Clients can make HTTP calls to search for products, search by category, filter by company name, filter by price, etc.

### [01. Initialize project with starter files]()
- Get starter project files from https://github.com/john-smilga/node-express-course/tree/main/04-store-api/starter

- Run `rm -rf .git` to avoid any issues if pushing to your own github repo
- Run `npm install` to install the nodemon, express, dotenv, express-async-errors, and mongoose libraries

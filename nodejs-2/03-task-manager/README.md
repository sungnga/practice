## SECTION 3: TASK MANAGER
- Folder directory: /03-task-manager/

### Goals of this project
- Learn how to setup API and connect to the cloud database. Learn how to persist data to the cloud
- Learn how to perform the CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations on the data
- The client can create, read, update, and delete tasks by sending requests to our API

### [01. Initialize project with starter files]()
- Get starter project files from https://github.com/john-smilga/node-express-course/tree/main/03-task-manager/starter
- cd into project directory: `cd 03-task-manager`
- Run `rm -rf .git` to avoid any issues if pushing to your own github repo
- Run `npm install` to install the nodemon, express, dotenv, and mongoose libraries
- Then run the script `npm start` to start up the project. This will run nodemon on app.js file

### [02. Basic Express server]()
- File: app.js
  ```js
  const express = require('express');
  const app = express();

  // routes
  app.get('/hello', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Task Manager App');
  });

  const port = 3000;

  app.listen(port, console.log(`Sever is listening on port ${port}...`));
  ```
